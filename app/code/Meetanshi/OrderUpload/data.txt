===== Magento 2 Order Attachment - 2 Hours - RQW-TRCXC-925 ===== 10-03-2023
We have gone live (Magento 2.4.3-p1) with the order attachment extension, but we see some issues,
please see our root cause and need your help in fixing these issues and update the plugin

Issue #1 - When doing the shipment import from the firebear extension, a group email is sent and some customer get wrong email
The extension overrides the Magento native function, but now this function has changed and currently,
the code is not fully compatible with the current Magento version (we are using 2.4.3-p1)
This is the out-of-date function of Meetanshi

\Meetanshi\OrderUpload\Helper\Template\TransportBuilder::prepareMessage

Also, the extension is missing the reset() function, so the previous data (customer name, email) is still available for the next email,
so that’s why some customers still get the wrong email.

protected function reset()
{
   $this->messageData = [];
   $this->templateIdentifier = null;
   $this->templateVars = null;
   $this->templateOptions = null;
   return $this;
}

Issue #2 - When order is placed from the Magento backend, it uses default sender email ID (wrong website) to send out the emails
This issue came from an Order Attachment extension, which they’re still using the out-of-date code from Magento.

\Meetanshi\OrderUpload\Model\Order\Email\SenderBuilder::configureEmailTemplate

$this->transportBuilder->setFrom($this->identityContainer->getEmailIdentity());

They’re calling a function setFrom (without store code) but currently, Magento changed to another function with store code inside (setFromByScope):

\Magento\Sales\Model\Order\Email\SenderBuilder::configureEmailTemplate

$this->transportBuilder->setFromByScope(
     $this->identityContainer->getEmailIdentity(),
     $this->identityContainer->getStore()->getId()
 );
